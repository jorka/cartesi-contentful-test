          "third-item": "Cartesi will allow mainstream developers to use the software tools, languages and components they are used to to create smart contracts in a way that will be similar to building traditional desktop or web applications. This will open the doors of adoption for millions of developers in the world to start creating decentralized applications.",

One that is going to bridge the power of 50 years of the traditional software infrastructure with existing blockchains/DLT's like Ethereum, Avalanche, and IOTA. With the missing piece in place, we are poised to see huge growth in the number and types of systems built on blockchain technology.",

          "eighth-item": "Cartesi's objective is not only about improving the scalability of smart contracts. Cartesi provides a Linux operating system for the development of smart contracts. Running an operating system is only possible because of the huge computational scalability it allows for and the VM tech the team has developed. This makes Cartesi unique compared to other scalability solutions."
