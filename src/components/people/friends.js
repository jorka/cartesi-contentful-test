          <p>
            Keeping connected via communities, our friends pool their ideas and
            expertise together. By acting as a catalyst to pull people together,
            we enable a greater sense of community and togetherness. With
            Cartesi forums, we see in-depth conversations and chat groups. (And
            with social media channels the news of course travels at pace).
            Thanks to Cartesi no matter what the conversation, thereâ€™s a group
            for everyone, everywhere.
