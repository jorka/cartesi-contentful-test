Cartesi is a layer-2 platform for the development and deployment of scalable decentralized applications. 
Cartesi DApps are composed of both blockchain and off-chain components. Off-chain components run inside Cartesi Nodes that represent the interests of each DApp user. 

Cartesi Nodes provide DApp developers with reproducible Cartesi Machines, where large scale verifiable computations can be run. 
These verifiable computations are easily integrated into smart contracts by powerful primitives that provide strong conflict resolution guarantees. 
More precisely, any dispute arising over the result of computations run inside Cartesi Machines can be fairly adjudicated at negligible cost on the blockchain. 

Cartesi Nodes also allow DApp developers to run native code. 
Native computations can leverage the nodeâ€™s full processing power, including any available GPUs. 
Whether performed natively by the node or inside Cartesi Machines, off-chain components run under a complete Linux operating system that provides the full ecosystem required by complex computations. 

Cartesi enables DApp developers to use all the programming languages, tools, libraries, software, and services they are already familiar with. 
By moving most of the complex logic of their DApps to portable off-chain components, developers are freed from the limitations and idiosyncrasies imposed by blockchains. 
In this way, Cartesi empowers developers to select the best run-time environment in which to host each part of their DApps.
