# Cartesi Labs Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

Cartesi is taking smart contracts to the next level. It is a chain-agnostic layer-2 infrastructure, solving the pressing problem of scalability on the most important blockchains. Most notably, Cartesi implements a unique Linux-supporting VM, rollups and side-chains to revolutionize the way developers create blockchain applications, allowing them to use mainstream software components.

To introduce developers to the Cartesi technology and toolchain, Cartesi has created the Cartesi Labs Program (the “Program”) to foster development of the Cartesi ecosystem through DApps, tools, or services. Participation in the Program is not necessary to build DApps or contribute to Cartesi. But if you choose to participate in the Program, these terms and conditions (the “Terms”) govern the relationship between you and Cartesi. This is a legal agreement. If you do not understand or do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you may not participate in the Program.

Cartesi reserves the right to modify these Terms at any time and will publish notice of any such modifications online on this page for a reasonable period of time following such modifications, and by changing the effective date of these Terms. By continuing to participate in the Program after notice of such changes have been posted, you signify your agreement to be bound by them. Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Terms.

## Participating in the Program

### Eligibility

Program participants may submit only new, original DApps or proposals. Program participants will be evaluated on their originality, the inventiveness of the problem solved, and novel use of the Cartesi platform, among other criteria. 

Any proposals deemed to be in bad taste by the Program organizers will not be eligible to compete. Concepts ruled indecent, defamatory, or that contain vulgar language, violence, pornography, obscenity or sexual activity are not eligible to compete. DApps cannot be used to obtain or describe any illegal substances or activities.

The Program organizers have sole and complete discretion to determine which concepts meet the established eligibility criteria.

Submissions received after the deadlines are not eligible to compete.

### Eligibility of Participants

Each proposal may be submitted on behalf of an individual or a team. Each individual, whether or not acting as part of a team, warrants the following:

- You are of legal age to form a binding contract (at least 18 years old in most jurisdictions);

- You have the right, full power and authority to enter into these Terms and Conditions, to exercise your rights and perform your obligations under these Terms and Conditions and in doing so will not violate any other agreement you have made;

- You are not under sanction by any country or the United Nations, nor are you a citizen of, or resident in or located in any country under sanction by the United Nations, United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, or any country of the European Union (specifically including Syria, Iran, Cuba, Crimea and North Korea).

Any submission made by an ineligible person, or by a team with an ineligible person, is disqualified, whether or not Cartesi is immediately aware of the ineligibility at the time. If an ineligible person or DApp is erroneously chosen for or receives a grant, such grant is void and immediately must be returned in full to Cartesi.

### Reasonable Documentation

If any question regarding the eligibility of a proposal or a Program participant arises, it is the responsibility of the Program participant to establish eligibility through the submission of appropriate documentation. If documentation is not or cannot be submitted, the person or proposal shall be considered ineligible. 

### Program Rules

In addition to these Terms, the Program may have Rules and a frequently asked questions page (FAQ). The Rules and FAQ are also incorporated into these Terms. If there is any discrepancy between these Terms and any part of the Rules or FAQ, these Terms control.

## The DApps You Create

### Your Ownership of Submitted DApps

Cartesi has no ownership or proprietary rights in the DApps you create for your submission. However, by submitting your DApp for evaluation in the Program, you are agreeing that you can and do provide Cartesi a license sufficient to fulfill all the Program purposes as described herein. This includes:

- All submissions, presentations and supporting materials must be in major part the original work of the person or team participating in the Program (the “Team”). Teams are responsible for ensuring that they own or have the right to use any intellectual property included in their submissions. 

- Each participant represents that any submissions from his/her team are the original work product of such Team and do not violate the copyright of any third party. Each participant further represents that, to the best of his or her knowledge, any submission by its team does not violate the trademark or any other intellectual property right or right of privacy or publicity of any third party.

- By creating and submitting DApps to the Program you represent and warrant that you are the owner and creator of the DApp, that you have the authority to grant a license to Cartesi and others for use of the DApp, and (ii) you will use the DApps in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. You, and not Cartesi, are solely responsible for your DApps and the use of them.

- All participants retain ownership of the intellectual property rights to their submissions. Participants are required to make their submissions available under an open source license recognized by the Open Source Initiative. Any recognized open source license will do, but the Apache v.2 license is preferred. If a reciprocal license (such as the GNU GPL, the GNU Affero GPL, or the CAL) is chosen, then you must also include a disclaimer and exception specifying that your code can be combined with the Cartesi SDK code without affecting the license terms for the Cartesi code. 

### The Relationship Between You and Cartesi

Cartesi is not, for legal or other purposes, a partner, joint venturer, principal, agent, manager, director, shareholder, or member of any participant or venture. Neither Cartesi nor any employee or contractor of Cartesi have any right, power, or authority to make decisions for or to bind legally any participant or venture, or to control any of the activities, business, or affairs of any participant or venture.

Participants are solely responsible for consulting with qualified professionals and investigating, understanding, and complying with any and all laws and regulations that may apply to their ventures and the activities in which such ventures may engage.

The Program organizers do not provide legal or tax advice to the participants or their ventures. Any guidance provided by Cartesi in connection with the Program is general in nature and may not apply to the facts of a specific matter. Please confer with qualified professionals to help you determine and comply with your legal and tax obligations.
