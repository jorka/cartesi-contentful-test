question: What is the utility of the Cartesi Token (CTSI)?
section: Token Questions
---

Cartesi aims to bring mainstream scalability and power to decentralized applications through a network of nodes. The CTSI token has been designed to **incentivize Cartesi Node operators** to engage with the system honestly and in an efficient way. It comprises the following use cases:

- **Cartesi Core:** the Cartesi Core relies on an **arbitration mechanism** that uses CTSI as collateral to enforce honest behavior;  
- **Cartesi Side Chain:** users of the Cartesi Side Chain pay for temporary data storage for Cartesi dApps with CTSI. Block generators receive **CTSI block rewards** and the fees paid by users adding data to the Side Chain;
- **Consensus System:** CTSI is used to participate in the Side Chain's **Proof-of-Stake consensus system.** Miners with the highest stakes have a higher probability of being selected to generate the next block;
- **Data Availability Protocol:** CTSI will also power a data availability protocol to aid with the transfer of large data blobs used for machine snapshots.
