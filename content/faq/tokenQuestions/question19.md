1,000,000,000 CTSI initially. As Cartesi will rely on a PoS-like system for the services it will offer, new CTSI may be periodically minted, in order to foster the participation rate of Worker Nodes.

We have specified a unique system that allows Cartesi to maximize the participation rate while limiting inflation and allowing workers to express their economic preferences. The system also allows for future deflationary scenarios. Therefore, if a lot of people participate in our network to earn a profit, it will demonstrate an elastic inflationary/deflationary effect.
