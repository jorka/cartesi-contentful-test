question: The decentralization of POS has recently become a focus of discussion. How does cartesi achieve full decentralization of its system?
section: Technical Questions

In Cartesi, we are committed to keeping the decentralization guarantees over other factors. For example, we do not plan to attain scalability by using "super-nodes" and instead, our nodes are expected to run on consumer hardware. The way we attain scalability is by locality (as we explained above, not everyone needs to know everything within the system).
