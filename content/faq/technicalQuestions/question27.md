question: What’s the advantage of Cartesi’s Layer-2 system compared with Nervos?
section: Technical Questions
---

Nervos is a blockchain project, whereas Cartesi is a Layer-2 system. We are similar in the sense that both projects employ a RISC-V architecture for the VM. Cartesi allows for great scalability that is not possible on the consensus layer (like on Nervos). Also, because on Cartesi the computational throughput is not capped by the capacities of the consensus mechanism, it's possible to run much heavier computation and boot a whole operating system, like Linux.

For instance, it is not possible to create a DApp on Nervos alone that leverages Linux and the software stacks it supports.
