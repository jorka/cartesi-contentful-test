question: What is the "Verifiability" in Cartesi? Is it truly secure and trustworthy?
section: Technical Questions
---

The verifiability component of Cartesi Core allows these complex computations to be adjudicated for correctness on the blockchain, at negligible cost, in a safe and decentralized way.

In practical terms, that means that any honest participant of a DApp running on Cartesi is able to prove to the blockchain they are correct even if all the other participants are malicious. And that's how users can count on the strong security guarantees of the blockchain when needed.

As mentioned above, Cartesi uses the blockchain as a supreme court, identifying and punishing dishonest parties. In the rare cases when these dispute resolutions arise, the blockchain runs an interactive dispute resolution and is left to run a single step of the original computation with a negligible amount of data.

And yes, it is secure and trustworthy. For a better understanding of the key principles that make Cartesi secure, we recommend reading our article "On Linux and Blockchains" or the tech paper. We are also glad to receive all security-related questions on our Discord channel.
