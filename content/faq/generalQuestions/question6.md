question: Can you give me a simple explanation of how Cartesi works?

Blockchains don't support mainstream computations that we take for granted on our computers and devices. Typically these computations comprise billions or trillions of steps and involve large amounts of data. The processing and data exceed by orders of magnitude the computational throughput capacity of a blockchain. We have also seen a lot of on-chain scaling solutions emerging, but none of them have achieved any significant and convincing results so far.

With Cartesi, we can have typical real-world computations running off-chain on a Linux environment (as they often do!), in a way that's verifiable by the blockchain. DApp users can achieve consensus off-chain and if there's an attempt of fraudulent computation, Cartesi uses the blockchain as a supreme court, identifying and punishing dishonest parties. In the rare cases when these dispute resolutions arise, the blockchain runs an interactive dispute resolution and is left to run a single step of the original computation with a negligible amount of data (we use a Verification Game implementation, akin to Truebit). That happens at a negligible cost to the blockchain. Btw, compared with some well-known Layer-2 solutions, Cartesi doesnâ€™t require parties to remain on-line all the time to participate. Therefore, Cartesi is a platform that users can enjoy the benefit of decentralization without sensing it.

Finally, the Cartesi Network and the Cartesi Token employ economic incentives and services that allow users to participate in DApps in a secure and convenient way.

More details to be released in the future.
