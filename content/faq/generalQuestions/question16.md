question: How about onboarding developers to create DApps for Cartesi?
section: General Questions
---

Throughout the past year, we’ve been exploring numerous ways and possibilities to onboard users, developers, and create an excellent developer ecosystem. Prior to the Binance IEO, we embarked on actions to initially build the Cartesi infrastructure and community-specific to cryptocurrency. During the past months, we’ve begun launching significant actions such as our ambassadorial program, exploring new clever tactics to raise awareness for Cartesi amongst developers, and most recently redesigning our website completely and launching the developer portal.

Our future actions to onboard users and developers rely heavily on delivering on what we set out to achieve, and through that, will open up many new opportunities to expose Cartesi to a heightened level. Accordingly, we’ve recently expanded our marketing team with a CMO candidate and are pursuing new initiatives.

The recent SDK documentation release opens up an entirely new field for the Cartesi team and it will make it significantly easier to communicate what Cartesi is (in technical terms) and aid developers in the direction of exploring, experimenting and ultimately building DApps with Cartesi’s technology.

We’ll be launching a variety of programs to coincide with this and encourage DApp development on Cartesi.
