question: What's your plan for growth? How do you attract users and developers?

Our initial plan for user growth relies on the Cartesi Network and its features. Cartesi will run a mine based on real-world computations. Instead of wasting electricity, Cartesi's mine will help to bootstrap the network of Workers running disputes created by Cartesi itself. We have a dedicated mining and staking pool of tokens reserved for this purpose. The mine fulfills three main objectives:

**1** - The establishment of an active pool of Cartesi Workers, with more and more computer power being incentivized to participate;  
**2** - The fair and even distribution of tokens to these miners;   
**3** - The continuous validation of the dispute resolution protocol and progressive improvement of the security of the Cartesi Network.
