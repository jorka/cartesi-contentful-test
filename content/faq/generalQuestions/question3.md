It's hard to imagine a future for decentralized applications without the infrastructure that Cartesi brings to the ecosystem.

Cartesi exists to provide the infrastructure for decentralized applications that are easier for developers to build and with a user experience comparable to Internet applications. Also, think about all veteran/mainstream software developers that will have a much lower entry barrier to develop DApps!
