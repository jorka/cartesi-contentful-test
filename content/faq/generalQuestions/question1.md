Cartesi is an off-chain decentralized computation platform. Cartesi is unique in the sense that it allows decentralized applications to be run on Linux in a way that's verifiable by the blockchain. Complex processing can be executed off-chain free from blockchains' computational limits and corresponding fees.

By offering a Linux runtime environment, Cartesi is the only software-based verifiable off-chain compute system that gives developers a vast array of software that evolved in the last 30 years and that enable the applications we use on the Internet today.
