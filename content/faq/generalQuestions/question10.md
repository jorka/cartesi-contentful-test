question: Is Cartesi a public chain? Whatâ€™s the TPS of Cartesi?
section: General Questions

Cartesi is not only about bridging the gap between a real OS and blockchain and providing virtually unlimited computational power.

The most important asset for Cartesi is a team of very strong researchers and engineers extremely excited to create and implement novelty in the blockchain space.

Cartesi has designed and redesigned itself several times, and a necessary space of experimentation has allowed us to understand better and better where we want to get, and our priorities.

Scalability is a multidimensional problem. With Cartesi Core and Descartes we empower computation. With upcoming roll-ups, we can essentially have smart-contracts being implemented and running on Linux. With the Side Chain, we can achieve much higher throughput, lower latencies, and cheaper temporary storage for DApps.

With these systems in place, we get something that could be analogous to general-purpose Linux servers, however, decentralized, efficient, and with the same security guarantees that the blockchain provides.

This is the fundamental roadmap of Cartesi for 2020 and 2021. That being said, there are other very important side projects being executed by the tech team. The PoS system of Cartesi Side Chain will allow people to stake and receive mining rewards. This should be ready before the conclusion of the Side Chain itself. Another important project is related to the creation of an infrastructure for greater convenience for DApp developers and users. We already provide preliminary information about it in the Documentation Portal.
