question: Which use cases does Cartesi intend to mainly focus on? Finance, logistics & optimization, or gaming? How will Cartesi collaborate with other Public blockchains to create these use cases?

Cartesi is a platform to endless possibilities and is not limited to one specific area. At Cartesi, we do not create the DApps, but will be working alongside developers to assist in implementing our technology.

We currently have 1 fully functional testnet DApp built on Cartesi, Creepts. We are really excited about Creepts as it was not only the first DApp on Cartesi but also a first for blockchains in general.

Creepts is a tournament over a tower defense game. It showcases a fully decentralized game that was developed using conventional software components and resources of Linux (it runs using Typescript and uses the file system). It also requires billions of microprocessor instructions (thus impossible to run on-chain).

Creepts is currently available via its website in a read-only version for easy access, or the fully decentralized version on the Testnet by installing the Cartesi Node and setting it up through instructions. [https://creepts.cartesi.io](https://creepts.cartesi.io)

We have recently announced the launch of the Descartes SDK Documentation portal: [https://cartesi.io/docs](https://cartesi.io/docs). The Descartes SDK makes it possible for developers to build computationally intensive DApps with all software tools available for a full Linux operating system. DApps preserve full decentralization and the security guarantees of Ethereum. The portal provides tutorials and the information needed to begin coding with Cartesi.

In regards to public blockchains, Cartesi is initially built on Ethereum and our plan is to be blockchain agnostic in the future. We are looking to build strategic partnerships with several public blockchains where we will benefit each other to rapidly increase adoption and release the killer DApps the community is searching for.
