question: What is Cartesiâ€™s biggest innovation and has it been academically verified?
section: General Questions
---

The biggest innovation that we bring with Cartesi is the ability to have typical real-world computations running off-chain on a Linux environment, in a way that's verifiable by the blockchain. DApp users can achieve consensus  off-chain and if there's an attempt of fraudulent computation, Cartesi uses the blockchain as a supreme court, identifying and punishing dishonest parties.

Cartesi Core has been specified by Diego Nehab and Augusto Teixeira who are both PhD researchers and reviewed by Cartesi's advisor Luiz Henrique de Figueiredo. Cartesi is, in fact, an academic research project and has been published via our technical whitepaper which can be found here: [https://cartesi.io/cartesi_whitepaper.pdf](https://cartesi.io/cartesi_whitepaper.pdf)
