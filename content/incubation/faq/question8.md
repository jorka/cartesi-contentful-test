Quadratic Funding is a mechanism that enables communities to dictate how a pool of funds is distributed among open-source projects for public benefit.. Find out more [here](https://gitcoin.co/wiki/grants/). Cartesi will offer a $20k matching pool to be distributed to the top three Cartesi projects. But the community gets to decide how those funds are distributed among the projects by "voting with their money" (ie. donating).However the match is not a 1 to 1 ratio, each project's matching amount is decided by both the number of unique donors and the amount donated. A $1 donation can go a long way!
