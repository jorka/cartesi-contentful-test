# This file is intended to maintain the hierarchy of questions on the FAQ section from Incubation page.
# Each question must have a markdown file on /content/incubation/faq/
# The first part of the markdown file is important to extract the question, so it must be the same on this file (faq.yaml), to correctly pull the data.
# The name of the file is not relevant.
