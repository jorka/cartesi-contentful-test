Check out "Quadratic Payments: A Primer" and "Quadratic Funding in a Nutshell" to get a better understanding. As a very simplified example, to demonstrate the "quadratic" nature, two individuals donating $5 each will earn the same match as one individual donating $25. Essentially, the idea of this mechanism is to give more power in allocating funds to the masses, as opposed to the wealthiest. The number of individual donors is weighted more heavily than the size of donation.
